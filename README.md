# Files Included:

* `List.h` - Header file for Doubly Linked List ADT.
* `List.c` - Implementation file for Doubly Linked List ADT.
* `Graph.h` - Header file for Graph ADT and Breadth-first search algorithm.
              Uses `List.h` for adjacency list representation and Breadth-first search.
* `Graph.c` - Implementation file for Graph ADT.
* `GraphTest.c` - File for testing Graph ADT functions. Creates & prints a 100-vertex Graph,
                  checks various distances, and then clears & prints the empty graph.
* `FindPath.c` - Implements scanner/writer with `Graph.h`. Creates Graph from vertices specified
                 in the given input file and prints adjacency list & shortest path(s) to
                 the given output file.
* `Makefile` - Creates an executable file called FindPath.
